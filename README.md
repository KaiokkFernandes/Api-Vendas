# SellManager API

## Description

**Api-Vendas** is a RESTful API developed in **Node.js** with **TypeScript**. This project is part of my studies in **Clean Architecture**, software design principles, and scalable API development.

The goal is to apply concepts like **separation of concerns**, **SOLID principles**, and a clear distinction between **domain, infrastructure, and application layers**.

## Main Features

* ✅ **Authentication with JWT**
* ✅ **Customer management (CRUD)**
* ✅ **Product management (CRUD) with image uploads**
* ✅ **Order management with item tracking**
* ✅ **Middleware-based validation and authentication**
* ✅ **Centralized error handling with custom exceptions**
* ✅ **Environment-based configuration**
* ✅ **Clean, modular, and scalable code structure inspired by Clean Architecture principles**

---

## Tech Stack

* **Node.js**
* **TypeScript**
* **Express.js**
* **TypeORM** (MySQL / PostgreSQL)
* **JWT** (Authentication)
* **Multer** (File uploads)
* **Yarn** (Package manager)

---

## Purpose

> 🚀 This project is a study case to learn and apply **Clean Architecture** concepts in a real Node.js API. It is not intended for production but for learning how to build **scalable**, **maintainable**, and **well-structured software.**

## Folder Structure (Based on Clean Architecture)

```
src/
 ┣ config/             → Config files (auth, upload, etc.)
 ┣ modules/            → Business logic (Customers, Products, Orders, Users)
 ┣ shared/
 ┃ ┣ errors/           → Custom error handling (AppError)
 ┃ ┣ http/             → Server config, routes
 ┃ ┣ middlewares/      → Authentication, error handling
 ┃ ┣ typeorm/          → Database entities, migrations, repositories
 ┗ index.ts            → App entry point
```

---

## Usage Example

* **Login:**

```http
POST /sessions
{
  "email": "admin@example.com",
  "password": "123456"
}
```

* Response:

```json
{
  "user": {
    "id": "uuid",
    "name": "Admin"
  },
  "token": "jwt-token"
}
```

Use the token in the header:

```
Authorization: Bearer jwt-token
```

## Build for Production

```bash
yarn build
node build/index.js
```
